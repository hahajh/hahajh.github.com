> "Haaaaaawwrrrblerp" Now my tone is low and gravelly, the coarse horn of a barge coming into shore, with a weird burping sound at the end. "Hawrblerp?" That can't be my line. I don't think it's even a word. Oh, God, I hope they don't think I actually burped. It was really more of a gargle, I tell myself-although I don't know which is worse. I can just picture the scene, post-audition: That actress? We brought her in and she positively belched all over the dialogue. Is she any good? Well, I suppose you could use her, if the part calls for lots of gargling. Sounds of cruel laughter , phones slamming into receivers, 8 X 10 glossies being folded into paper airplanes and aimed into wastepaper baskets Career over, the end. 
"하아아아아아아브르" 지금 나의 톤은 낮고 걸걸한, 해안으로 부터 오는 바지선의 거친 호각 같았다. 끝에는 이상한 트림 소리와 함께였다. "Hawrblerp" 그것은 내 소리일리 없다. 나는 그것이 심지어 단어라고 생각하지 않는다. 오, 이런, 나는 그들이 내가 실제로 트림했다고 생각하지 않기를 바란다. 그것은 정말 가글하는 소리 보다 더하다. 나는 더 나쁜 것이 있을 지 모른다고 생각했다. 나는 정확히 오디션의 다음 장면을 상상할 수 있다. 저 배우? 우리는 그녀를 안으로 데려왔고 그녀는 긍정적으로 대사를 사방에 내뿜었다. 그녀가 쓸만한가? 글쎄, 만약 그 부분이 엄청 많은 가글링을 필요로 한다면 당신이 그녀를 쓸 것이라고 생각한다. 잔인한 웃음 소리, 수신자에게 충돌하는 전화, 종이 비행기를 접는 8 x 10 색종이들 그리고 폐지 바구니로 향하는 커리어. 끝이다. 

> "Franny?" I can't see who's speaking because the spotlight is so bright, but they're getting impatient, I can tell. My heart is pounding and my palms are starting so sweat. I've got to find my voice, or they'll ask me to leave. Or worse - they'll drag me off stage with one of those giant hooks you see i old movies. In Elizabethan times the audience would throw rotten eggs at the actors if they didn't like a performance. They don't still do that, do they? This is Broadway, or at least, I think it is. They wouldn't just throw - 
"Franny?" 나는 빛이 너무 밝아서 누가 나를 부르는지 볼 수 없었다. 그러나 나는 그들은 점점 짜증이 나고 있다고 말할 수 있다. 내 심장은 쿵쿵 거렸고 내 손바닥들은 매우 젖어가기 시작했다. 나는 내 목소리를 찾을 수 있거나 그드릉ㄴ 나에게 가라고 말을 하거나 혹은 더 나쁠 수 있다. 그들은 나를 내가 오래된 영화에서 보았던 커다란 hooks들 중 하나와 함께 스테이지 밖으로 끌어낼 것이다. Elizabethan 시대엔 공연이 마음에 들지 않으면 배우들에게 썩은 달걀을 던졌었다. 그들은 여전히 그렇지 않는다. 그렇겠지? 이곳은 브로드웨이 이다. 최소한 나는 그렇게 생각한다. 그들은 막 던지지 않을 ... 

> The tomato bounces off my leg and onto the bare wood floor of the stage
토마토가 내 다리를 쳤다. 그리고 스테이지의 마른 바닥에 떨어졌다. 

> Splat.

> "Franny? Franny?"

> I open my eyes halfway. I can see see from the window above my bed that it's another gray and drizzly January day. I can see that because I took the curtains down right after Christmas in order to archieve one of my New Year's resolutions, of becoming an earlier riser. Successful actresses are disciplined people who wake up early to focus on their craft, I told myself - even onew who still make their living as waitresses - like me. I started leaving the alarm clock on the landing between jane's room and mine so I'd have to actually get out of bed in order to turn it off, instead of hitting snooze over and over like I normally do. I also resolved to quit smoking again, to stop losing purses, wallets, and umbrellas, and to not eat any more cheese puffs, not even on special occasions. But I already had two cigarettes yesterday, and although the sun is obscured by the cloudy sky, I'm fairly certain it is far from my new self-appointed rising time of eight A.M. My three-day abstinence from cheese puffs and the umbrella still downstairs by the front door are my only accomplishments of the year so far. 

> "Franny?"

> Only half-awake, I roll over and squint down at the pitted wood floor by my bed, where I notice one black leather Reebok high-top lying on its side. That's strange. It's mine - one of my waitressing shoes - but I thought I'd left them them outside the - thwack - a second Reebok whizzes by, hitting the dust ruffle and disappearing underneath.

> "Franny? Sorry, you didn't respond to me knocking." Dan's voice is muffled and anxious from behind my bedroom door. "I didn't hit you with the shoe, did I?" 

> Ahhh, it was my shoe that hit me on the leg, not a tomato. What a relief. 

> "I dreamed it was a tomato!" I yell at the half-open door.
"You want me to come back later?" Dan calls back anxiously.
"Come in!" I should probably get out of bed and put Dan out of his misery, but it's so cold. I just want one more minute in bed. 
"What? Sorry, Franny, I can't quite hear you. you asked me to make sure you were up, remember?"
I suppose I did, but I still too grogggy to focus on the details. Normally I would've asked our other roommate, my best friend, jane, but she's been working nights as a P.A. on that new Russell Blakely movie. Since Dan moved into the bedroom downstairs a few months ago, I haven't noticed much about him except how unnecessarily tall he is, how many hours he spends writing at the computer, and the intense fear he seems to have about coming upon either of us when we're not decent. 
"Dan! Come in!"
"You are decent?"

> In fact, I went to sleep in an outfit that far exceeds decent, even by Dan's prudish standards: heavy sweatpants and a down vest I grrabbed last night after the radiator in my room sputtered and spat hot water on the floor, then completely died with a pathetic hiss. But that's what you get in Park Slpoe, Brooklyn for $500 a month each.
